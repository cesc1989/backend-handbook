# Dependencies

This section includes all software a basic Ruby on Rails application would require in order to run. Databases, datastores, web servers, app servers, libraries, and more.

The list of packages or software projects described in this section was gathered from my experience working in different RoR projects. It might be very useful for several scenarios or might lack other packages for other, but regardess, works as a good starting point.
