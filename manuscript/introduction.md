# Introduction

This is a guide to help you get started in the process of provisioning and setting up Ubuntu(14.04+) servers. Although, born from doing configuration for Ruby on Rails applications, many parts of this document can be used for many other things.

The Backend Handbook contains information to configure development tools such as Vagrant or Jenkins. The handboook also covers how to setup servers from scratch(those you get in Digital Ocean or Linode), creating system users, and more.

You will find instructions for several software such as:

* Development libraries
* PostgreSQL
* RVM
* Ruby
* NodeJS
* Redis
* WKHTMLTOPDF
* etc
