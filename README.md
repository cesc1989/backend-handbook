# Backend Handbook

The purpose of this book is to serve as a guide for setting up, mainly, Ubuntu 14.04 servers with most of the popular dependencies, including:

* PostgreSQL
* RVM
* Ruby \(from source\)
* NodeJS
* Redis
* WKHTMLTOPDF
* Development libraries
* etc

With this guide the reader would be able to setup a brand new server from scratch, this goes from creating users up until deploying Rails\(most of the time\) applications.
