# Backend Handbook

The purpose of this book is to serve as a guide for setting up Ubuntu 14.04 servers with many dependencies including:

* PostgreSQL
* RVM
* Ruby \(from source\)
* NodeJS
* Redis
* WKHTMLTOPDF
* Development libraries
* etc

By using this guide, you would be able to setup brand new servers from scratch, going from creating system users to deploying Ruby on Rails(most of the time) applications.
