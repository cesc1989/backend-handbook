# Setup

The idea behind this section is to help you get started setting up your brand new server. This process, though easy to complete, can get a wrong turn when commands are not issued carefully.

One of the things I've learnt about setting up servers before writing this handbook is that computers are betters than humans when automating things. So, it is way better to have scripts and then use them as many times as we need rather than manually issuing commands in the console one by one.

## Section Contents

The contents of this section are going to be divided in two areas: Linode and AWS. Turns out that when configuring Linode (Ubuntu 14.04) machines the process is very different to doing this in AWS machines.

- See [Linode](linode.md) for configuring Linode machines.
- See [AWS](aws.md) for configuring AWS machines.
