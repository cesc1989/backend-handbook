# Setup

This section will help you to get started setting up your brand new server. This process, though easy to complete, can get a wrong turn when commands are not issued carefully.

One of the things I've learnt about setting up servers before writing this handbook is that computers are better than humans when automating things, so, it's way better to have scripts and then use them as many times as we need rather than manually issuing commands in the console one by one.

## Section Contents

This section is divided in two areas: Linode and AWS. Turns out that when configuring Linode machines the process is very different than doing it in AWS machines.

- See [Linode](linode.md) for configuring Linode machines.
- See [AWS](aws.md) for configuring AWS machines.
